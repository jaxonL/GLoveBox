# GLoveBox

## Short description

Give and receive love on-chain.

## Long description

In a world filled with fleeting digital connections, negativity, and isolation, we’re craving connection that is unconditional, intentional, and persistent. Glove Box is an on-chain anonymous messenger to send and receive simple, positive messages that can brighten someone’s day and lift up their overall mental well-being. Messages are sent anonymously and received anonymously.

## How It's Made

The experience is built on Skale as we wanted the most seamless experience for users to receive and give love on-chain. Skale's gas-free actions enable and encourage users to share more positive vibes with others in greater frequency. In addition, Skale's interoperability allows GloveBox to scale and grow across networks to best accommodate users. It was the team’s first time using and deploying contracts on Skale and were excited and impressed at the ease to deploy the contract.

Messages sent on GloveBox only include text. Currently, all metadata is stored in smart contracts. We anticipate utilizing servers to support metadata storage as GloveBox scales.

The Front-End was designed in Figma, and implemented using React.
