Project Submission

# Short description
Give and receive love on-chain. 

# Long description
In a world filled with fleeting digital connections, negativity, and isolation, we’re craving connection that is unconditional, intentional, and persistent. Glove Box is an on-chain anonymous messenger to send and receive simple, positive messages that can brighten someone’s day and lift up their overall mental well-being. Messages are sent anonymously and received anonymously. 

# How It's Made
Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details. What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together? If you used sponsor technology how did it benefit your project? Did you do anything particularly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning? How did you impress yourself which what your team built?

The experience is built on Skale as we wanted the most seamless experience for users to receive and give love on-chain. Skale's gas-free actions enable and encourage users to share more positive vibes with others in greater frequency. In addition, Skale's inoperablility allows GloveBox to scale and grow across networks to best accomodate to users. 

Messages sent only include text. And currently, all metadata is stored in smart contracts. We ancitipate utilizing servers to support metadata storage as GloveBox scales.
